By measuring regularly, we can quickly detect any changes in your health.

During your consultation with the doctor, we will review the measurements from the past period. This helps us to recognize trends and adjust your treatment if necessary.

How often you need to measure may vary. For example, if you're currently measuring weekly, it might change to monthly in the future. We will contact you if this applies to you.
